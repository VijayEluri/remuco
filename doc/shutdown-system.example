# Example shutdown script which uses DBus.
# Put this into ~/.config/remuco and rename it to 'shutdown-system' to enable
# Remuco clients to remotely shut down the whole system (not only the media
# player).

# Note: If you enable this script, a malicious neighbor might use Remuco on
#       _his_ mobile and shutdown _your_ computer!
