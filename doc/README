Remuco - Remote media player control

Remuco is a duplex remote control system for Linux media players and mobile
devices equipped with Bluetooth or WiFi. With Remuco you can remotely control
your favorite media player - amongst others you can switch to the next,
previous or any other media within the current playlist, browse your media
library and activate other playlists, rate your media and adjust volume. On the
mobile (the remote control) it displays information about the current media,
including cover art. Visit http://remuco.sourceforge.net for a complete feature
list, screenshots and a list of supported media players.

1. Installation

Run

 $ make help
 
to get instructions on how to install Remuco for one or more media players.

Subsequent, install the client application on your mobile device. You find the
required JAR and JAD files in the directory 'client'.
How to install is device dependent - please consult the documentation of your
mobile device.

2. Usage

2.1 Player Adapters

Some player adapters need to get started manually, others get started
automatically when the corresponding player application starts. Please visit
http://remuco.sourceforge.net/index.php/Getting_Started for player specific
information.

Each player adapter has a configuration file ~/.config/remuco/<PLAYER>/conf.
Edit this file if needed. Logging output of a player adapter goes to
~/.cache/remuco/<PLAYER>/log.

2.2 Client

Using the client is not too complicated, just start and use it ;) .

Nevertheless, you'll find some usage information here:
http://remuco.sourceforge.net/index.php/Getting_Started

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

3. Player Adapter Development

To develop a player adapter, use 'fooplay' as a template and implement it as
described in the file 'api.html'.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

4. Packager Information

Packagers should not use the top level make file- this is a wrapper around
nested make files intended for end users. Instead the setup.py script in
base/module and the make files in adapter/XXX should be used directly.

A.2. Source Code Access

You can get the source code via SVN. The SVN root is:
https://remuco.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/remuco

To browse the SVN repository visit:
http://remuco.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/remuco

The most current code is located in "trunk". Note that this code is not always
stable or in a working state. The sources of specific releases are located in
"tags" -- getting code from "tags" ensures to have working code.

Example A-1. Check out the current development version into the
directory remuco-trunk:

 $ svn co <SVN-ROOT>/trunk remuco-trunk

Example A-2. Check out the source from release 0.8.0 into the directory
remuco-0.8.0:

 $ svn co <SVN-ROOT>/tags/0.8.0 remuco-0.8.0
