# Example shell script to control master volume with 'amixer'.
#
# Usage:
#     volume [PERCENT]
# Example:
#     volume
#     -> prints out current volume in percent
#     volume {up|down|mute}
#     -> increase or decrease volume (by 5 percent) or mute volume
#
# Put this script with name 'volume' into a player adapter's configuration
# directory (e.g. ~/.config/remuco/fooplay) to disable the player's volume
# control and enable volume control as done here. To use this volume script for
# all players, put it into ~/.config/remuco.
# 
# If this script does not work correctly, have a look into 'man amixer' for how
# to tweak the lines below.

CONTROL=Master
