   Remuco is a bluetooh remote control system for linux media
   players. With Remuco you can remotely control your favourite
   media player - amongst others you can switch to the next,
   previous or any other media within the current playlist,
   browse your media library, rate your media and adjust volume.
   On the mobile (i.e. the remote control) it displays
   information about the current media, including cover art.
   Visit remuco.sf.net for a complete feature list, screenshots

3. Installation

   The two files remuco.jar and remuco.jad (on some devices you
   only need the jar-file) of a particluar client variant needs
   to be installed on your mobile. How this is done is device
   dependent. Inspect the manual of your mobile for how to
   install Java ME applications.

   E.g. on a Sony Ericcson K750i you copy the files onto the
   memory stick. Then you browse to that file with the mobiles
   file browser and select 'install' on the jad-file. Some Nokia
   phones require to use special software on your computer to
   install something on the mobile. .. as said, please inspect
   your mobile's manual.

4. Usage

   When you start the Remuco client, it automatically scans for
   near bluetooth devices. After a few seconds it presents you a
   list of detected devices. Choose your computer which runs the
   Remuco server. The client then connects to the server. Once
   the connection is up, you see the current music player state
   displayed on your device.
