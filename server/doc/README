     Remuco is a Bluetooth remote control system for Linux media players. With
    Remuco you can remotely control your favorite media player - amongst others
    you can switch to the next, previous or any other media within the current
    playlist, browse your media library, rate your media and adjust volume. On
    the mobile (i.e. the remote control) it displays information about the
    current media, including cover art. Visit remuco.sf.net for a complete
    feature list, screenshots and a list of supported media players.

1. Introduction

 This documentation is about the Remuco server library. This library implements
a server to connect with Remuco clients and provides functionality to
communicate media player data with Remuco clients. The library gets used by
player proxies which interact with a specific (music) player.

2. Building

 To build, run:

 $ make

 This automatically checks for build requirements.

 This installs into /usr/... If you prefer another prefix, e.g. /usr/local, run
the following instead:

 $ PREFIX=/usr/local make install

5. Writing Player Proxies

 TODO .. for now I just can refer you to the source code of the existent player
proxies and the API documentation in the server source package.

A.2. Source Code Access

 You can get the source code via SVN. The SVN root is: https://

 To browse the SVN repository visit: http://remuco.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/
remuco

 The most current code is located in "trunk" . Note that this code is not
always stable or in a working state. The sources of specific releases of the
several parts of the Remuco system (server library, client, ...) are located in
"tags" -- getting code from "tags" ensures to have working code.

Example A-1. Check out the current development version of the server library
into the directory remuco-server-trunk:

  $ svn co <SVN-ROOT>/trunk/server remuco-server-trunk

Example A-2. Check out the client source from release 0.6.0 into the directory
remuco-client-0.6.0:

  $ svn co <SVN-ROOT>/tags/remuco-client-0.6.0 remuco-client-0.6.0
