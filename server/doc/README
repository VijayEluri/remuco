Remuco Server 0.7

 Remuco is a Bluetooth/WLAN remote control system for Linux media players. With
Remuco you can remotely control your favorite media player - amongst others you
can switch to the next, previous or any other media within the current
playlist, browse your media library and activate other playlists, rate your
media and adjust volume. On the mobile (i.e. the remote control) it displays
information about the current media, including cover art. Visit http://
remuco.sourceforge.net for a complete feature list, screenshots and a list of
supported media players.

1. Introduction

 This documentation is about the Remuco server. The server runs on your
computer and intermediates between media players (respectively their Remuco
player proxies) and Remuco clients.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

2. Building

 To build the server, run:

 $ make

 This also checks build requirements and tells you what is needed if something
is missing.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

3. Installation

 To install the server, run (as root, if needed):

 $ make install

 This installs the server below /usr/bin. For an alternative installation
prefix run:

 $ PREFIX=/home/xyz/opt make install

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

4. Usage

4.1. Server

 The server gets automatically started by DBus, if player proxies contact the
server.

 The server's behavior can be adjusted with the file ~/.config/remuco/
Server.conf. An example of this file is contained in this package.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

4.2. Basic Player Proxies (BPP)

 Basic player proxies are simple configuration files which provide a fast and
easy way to extend Remuco with support for a certain media player (see the
website for more detailed information on BPPs). To enable BPPs, you have to
start the BPP launcher:

 $ remuco-bpp-launcher

 The launcher looks for all present BPPs and activates them if the
corresponding media player is running.

 Example BPPs are contained in this package. You may copy the BPPs you need to
~/.config/remuco (with the suffix .example removed). Have a look into the BPP
files you've copied - it may be necessary to adjust them for your system.

Note The Remuco website may provide more BPPs or more recent versions of the
     BPPs in this package.

5. Troubleshooting

 To track down errors, please try the steps below. If this does not solve your
problem, come to the help forum.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

5.1. General

 If something fails, it is a good idea to set Remuco into debug mode. This is
done by creating the file ~/.config/remuco/debug, for instance:

 $ touch ~/.config/remuco/debug

 This tells the server and all player proxies to enable debug output. The
server log can be found in ~/.cache/remuco/Server.log. Log sinks of player
proxies are proxy specific.

Note Don't forget to remove ~/.config/remuco/debug once you don't need the
     debug output anymore.

A.2. Source Code Access

 You can get the source code via SVN. The SVN root is: https://
remuco.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/remuco

 To browse the SVN repository visit: http://remuco.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/
remuco

 The most current code is located in "trunk". Note that this code is not always
stable or in a working state. The sources of specific releases are located in
"tags" -- getting code from "tags" ensures to have working code.

Example A-1. Check out the current development version of the server into the
directory remuco-server-trunk:

 $ svn co <SVN-ROOT>/trunk/server remuco-server-trunk

Example A-2. Check out the client source from release 0.7.0 into the directory
remuco-client-0.7.0:

 $ svn co <SVN-ROOT>/tags/client-0.7.0 remuco-client-0.7.0
