# This section contains miscellaneous options.

# The type of the image to send to clients. Possible are all types understood
# by ImageMagick. Default is 'jpg' as it generally provides small image sizes
# and therefore reduces server <-> client communication. However, certain mobile
# devices do not understand JPEG, in that case you must set this to 'png' (which
# mostly means bigger images).
# If set to 'none' or '' then no images will be send to clients.
#img = jpg 

# The maximum length of lists (playlists, queue). Any list from a player will
# be truncated to this limit before it gets send to a client. This is because
# the limited memory of mobile devices. 
# Default value is '100'. Increase it if you have a mobile device with a lot
# of RAM.
#list-limit = 100

# A command to shut down your computer. Gets executed when a client issues
# the command 'Shutdown Host'. The user running Remuco must have appropriate
# rights to execute this command. For instance you could this set this option
# 'sudo /sbin/shutdown'.
# Default value is '', i.e. system shutdown by a client is disabled.
#shutdown = 

# As described in the manual page, normally basic player proxies (BPPs) only
# get started if the server has been started manually (i.e. not automatically
# by a full player proxy). If you set this to 'true', the server always starts
# BPPs, independent of how it has been started.
# Default value is 'false'.
#always-start-bpps = false

# 'true' enables clients to connect with WLAN.

# The TCP port clients can connect to with WLAN.
