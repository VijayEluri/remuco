# The type of the image to send to clients. Possible are all types understood
# by ImageMagick. Default is 'jpg' as it generally provides small image sizes
# and therefore reduces server <-> client communication. However, certain mobile
# devices do not understand JPEG, in that case you must set this to 'png' (which
# mostly means bigger images).
# If set to 'none' or '' then no images will be send to clients.
#img = jpg

# be truncated to this limit before it gets send to a client.
# Default value is '100'.
