This installs the Remuco moudle uses by all player adapters. Now run: 

$ make install-<PLAYER>

to install a player adapter of your choice. Multiple player adapters can be
installed and used simultaneously.


=== Usage =====================================================================

Rhythmbox .....................................................................

The Rhythmbox player adapter is realized as a Rhythmbox plugin. Just start
Rhythmbox and activate the Remuco plugin.

XMMS2 .........................................................................

The XMMS2 player adapter is realized as a XMMS2 startup script. It automatically
gets started when XMMS2 starts. It requires XMMS2 >= 0.5 and the XMMS2 Python
bindings.

=== Configuration and Logging =================================================

Each player adapter has a configuration file ~/.config/remuco/<PLAYER>/conf.
Edit this file if needed. Logging output of a player adapter goes to
~/.cache/remuco/<PLAYER>/log.


=== Player Adapter Development ================================================

To develop a player adapter, use 'fooplay' as a template and implement it as
described in the file 'pa-api.html'.
