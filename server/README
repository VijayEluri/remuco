Remuco (remuco.sf.net) - Server
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction

Remuco is a bluetooh remote control system for music player. In addition to
controlling, it displays handy information about the music player currently
controlled (playlist, infos about the current song). If the music player
supports that, it is even possible to rate your songs remotely. 

This is the Remuco server, an application running on your computer and 
interacting with a music player and remote clients on Bluetooth devices.

*******************************************************************************
Build
*******************************************************************************

For each music player to control a corresponding server binary needs to be
build.

Requirements to build server binaries:

- General:
	Development package of libbluetooth and libc need to be installed.

- XMMS:
	Development packages of xmms and libid3tag need to be installed.

- XMMS2:
	Development package of libxmms2client needs to be installed.

- Amarok:
	Development package of python needs to be installed.	

To build the server binary for the music player FOOPLAYER, execute:

$ make PP=FOOPLAYER

A specific example:

$ make PP=xmms2

This creates a Remuco server binary you can use to control xmms2. The binary
is called 'remuco-xmms2'.

*******************************************************************************
Install
*******************************************************************************

To install, execute:

$ make PP=FOOPLAYER install

A specific example:

$ make PP=xmms2 install

This will install the binary into $(BIN_DIR) and possibly other needed files
into $(REM_DIR)/PLAYER. The variables BIN_DIR and REM_DIR get defined in the
Makefile. The default values are:
BIN_DIR := /usr/local/bin
REM_DIR := /usr/local/lib/remuco
These variables must not be changed between build and install!

*******************************************************************************
Usage
*******************************************************************************

See the sections 'Requirements' and 'Usage' in the file README.FOOPLAYER
where FOOPLAYER is the music player you want to control.
