"""Remuco player adapter module.

This module provides classes and constants for Remuco player adapters.

Class PlayerAdapter:
    Base class for player adapters.

Class Manager:
    Helper class for managing the life cycle of a player adapter.

Constants:
    The constants starting with 'INFO' are the keys to use for the dictionary
    describing a PLOB (PLOB means playable object - a song, video, slide or
    whatever may be played in that spirit).
    
    The constants starting with 'PLAYBACK' are the values used by Remuco to
    describe a playback state.

Logging:
    It is recommended to use the remuco logging system within player adapters.
    To do so, import the module 'remuco.log' and use the functions
    
    * remuco.log.debug(),
    * remuco.log.info(),
    * remuco.log.warning() and
    * remuco.log.error().
    
    Then all messages of the player adapter will be written into the same file
    as used internally by the remuco module - that makes debugging a lot easier.
    
    Internally Remuco uses the module 'logging' for all its logging messages.
    Messages go into a player specific log file (usually
    ~/.cache/remuco/PLAYER/log). The log level is defined in a player specific
    configuration file (usually ~/.config/remuco/PLAYER/conf).

class PlayerAdapter:
    """Base class for Remuco player adapters.
    
    Remuco player adapters must subclass this class and overwrite certain
    methods to implement player specific behavior. Additionally PlayerAdapter
    provides methods to interact with Remuco clients. Following is a summary
    of all relevant methods, grouped by functionality. 
    
    Methods to overwrite to manage life cycle:
    
        * start()
        * stop()
    
        A PlayerAdapter can be started and stopped with start() and stop().
        Subclasses of PlayerAdapter may override these methods as needed but
        must always call the super class implementations too! The same instance
        of a PlayerAdapter should be startable and stoppable multiple times.
    
    Methods to overwrite to control the media player:
    
        * ctrl_jump_in_playlist()
        * ctrl_jump_in_queue()
        * ctrl_load_playlist()
        * ctrl_next()
        * ctrl_previous()
        * ctrl_rate()
        * ctrl_toggle_playing()
        * ctrl_toggle_repeat()
        * ctrl_toggle_shuffle()
        * ctrl_seek_backward()
        * ctrl_seek_forward()
        * ctrl_tag()
        * ctrl_volume()
    
        Not all methods must be overwritten. Some even do not make sense for
        certain players, e.g. ctrl_jump_in_queue() only should be overwritten
        if the media player has a play queue. Do not overwrite methods you
        finally do not implement because Remuco checks which methods has been
        overwritten and uses this information to notify Remuco clients about
        capabilities of player adapters.

    Methods to overwrite to provide information from the media player:
    
        * request_plob()
        * request_playlist()
        * request_queue()
        * request_library()
    
        As above, only overwrite the methods that makes sense for the
        corresponding media player. 
    
    Methods to call to send media player information to clients:
    
        * update_position()
        * update_playback()
        * update_repeat()
        * update_shuffle()
        * update_plob()
        
        These methods should be called whenever the corresponding information
        has changed in the media player. Subclasses of PlayerAdapter may
        overwrite the method poll() to periodically check a player's state. 
        
        * reply_plob_request()
        * reply_playlist_request()
        * reply_queue_request()
        * reply_library_request()
        
        These methods should be called to reply to calls to one of the
        request methods above.
        
    Finally some utility methods:
    
        * get_image()
        * get_cache_dir()
        * get_log_file()
        * get_clients()
