""" Remuco player adapter module.

The module 'remuco' is the interface between a media player and the Remuco
system. It provides one class and several constants.

The class Player is supposed to be sub classed by Remuco adapters for specific
media players.

Some notes on logging:

Remuco uses the module 'logging' for all its logging messages. By default
logging is configured to log into a player specific log file (usually
~/.cache/remuco/PLAYER/log). The log level is defined in the player specific
configuration file (usually ~/.config/remuco/conf).

To use the remuco logging system within a player adapter, import the module
'log' and us the function log.debug(), log.info(), log.warning() and
log.error(). Then all messages of the player adapter will be written into the
same file which is used for internal remuco logging messages.

class Player:

    """ Class for Remuco player adapters to derive from. 
    
    Player is a class any media player adapter is supposed to derive from.
    It provides some methods media player adapters can use to interact with
    Remuco clients and some methods which must be overwritten by sub classes
    in order to implement player specific behavior.
    
    The following methods can be used to interact with clients:
    
    * update_play_position()
    * update_playback()
    * update_playlist()
    * update_queue()
    * update_queue_mode()
    * update_repeat_mode()
    * update_shuffle_mode()
    * update_plob()
    
    * reply_plob_request()
    * reply_list_request()
    
    The term PLOB means playable object and simply refers to a song, a video
    or whatever you can imagine as a playable object. 

    The following methods should be overwritten by sub classes to implement
    media player specific behavior:
    
    * get_rating_max()
    * jump_to()
    * play_next()
    * play_previous()
    * rate_current()
    * toggle_play_pause()
    * toggle_repeat()
    * toggle_shuffle()
    * seek_backward()
    * seek_forward()
    * set_tags()
    * set_volume()
    
    * request_plob()
    * request_playlist()
    
    Not all methods must be overwritten. Some even do not make sense for
    certain players, e.g. get_rating_max() only should be overwritten if the
    media player supports rating.
    
    If a player adapter needs a cache directory, it can get one via
    get_cache_dir(). If a player adapter wants to integrate log information
    into the media player UI, it has to call get_log_file() to get the name
    of the log file used within remuco to log messages.
