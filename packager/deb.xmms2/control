Description: Remuco player proxy for XMMS2
 Remuco is a Bluetooth/WLAN remote control system for Linux media players. With
 Remuco you can remotely control your favorite media player - amongst others you
 can switch to the next, previous or any other media within the current
 playlist, browse your media library and activate other playlists, rate your
 media and adjust volume. On the mobile (i.e. the remote control) it displays
 information about the current media, including cover art.
 .
 This package contains the XMMS2 player proxy to use Remuco with XMMS2. It
 contains the player proxy as an executable. To let the proxy get started
 automatically by XMMS2, it must be placed or linked to in users' XMMS2 startup
 script directory - for details see the README.
