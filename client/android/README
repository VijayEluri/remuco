Developer Info
==============

Initial Android project
-----------------------

This Android project has been created using the following command:

    $ android create project --target 1 --name Remuco --path . \
          --activity Remuco --package remuco.client.android

The `local.properties` file has been added to `.hgignore`, but an example
file `local.properties.example` is available in the repository.

The initial commit introducing the Android project files does not have any
addtional changes, than those mentioned above.

Basic implementation
--------------------

In it's current state the client already connects to a player adapter if the
client runs in an emulator and if the adapter runs on the host which runs the
emulator.

I hope it shows how thinks principally work.

IDE vs. Ant
-----------

Though the Android Eclipse plugin is a good way to develop for Android, the
`client/android` folder should not contain IDE specific files - it should
always be possible to build the Android client using the Ant `build.xml` file.

Building the client
-------------------

    $ cd /path/to/remuco/client/android
    $ ant debug

Testing the client
------------------

Use the Android SDK *emulator* tool to start an emulator for an Android 1.1
device. Then install the app:

    $ ant install # or reinstall

Now the app can be started and tested on the emulated device.
