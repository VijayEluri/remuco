Remuco (remuco.sf.net) - Client
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction
************

Remuco is a bluetooh remote control system for music player. In addition to
controlling, it displays handy information about the music player currently
controlled (playlist, infos about the current song). If the music player
supports that, it is even possible to rate your songs remotely. 

This is the Remuco client, an application running on a mobile device with J2ME
and Bluetooth (JSR 82) support.

Note: The most current and more detailed doucmentation can be found at
      remuco.sf.net !

Building
********

If you've got source package see documentation within the file 'build.xml' for
how to build a binary pacakge.

Installation
************

The client package contains three variants of the client:

1. Simple
   Client with a simple, mostly text based user interface.
   Runs on mobile devices with CLDC >= 1.1 and MIDP >= 2.0.
2. Canvas
   Client with a graphical and themeable user interface.
   Uses joystick and numpad keys for controlling.
   Runs on mobile devices with CLDC >= 1.1 and MIDP >= 2.0.
   For this client a screen of at least 120x150 pixel is recommended!
3. Legacy
   Client similar to simple, but adopted to be compatible with older mobile
   devices which only support CLDC 1.0 and MIDP 1.0.
   Runs on mobile devices with CLDC >= 1.0 and MIDP >= 1.0.
   (In theory, I could not test this client on a real device. Please give me
   some feedback if this client works or not on your CLDC-1.0/MIDP-1.0 device.)
   
Pick the client that fits most to your mobile.
The Java ME device table at the Sun website
(http://developers.sun.com/techtopics/mobility/device/device) may help you to
decide which client is the best choice.

The two files remuco.jar and remuco.jad (on some devices you only need the
jar-file) of a particluar client variant needs to be installed on your mobile.
How this is done is device dependent. Inspect the manual of your mobile for how
to install Java ME applications.

E.g. on a Sony Ericcson K750i you copy the files onto the memory stick. Then
you browse to that file with the mobiles file browser and select 'install'
on the jad-file.
Some Nokia phones require to use special software on your computer to install
something on the mobile.
.. as said, please inspect your mobile's manual.

How to use
**********

When you start the Remuco client, it automatically scans for near bluetooth
devices. After a few seconds it presents you a list of detected devices.
Choose your computer which runs the Remuco server.

The client then connects to the server. Once the connection is up, you see
the current music player state displayed on your device.

How to use the client from now depends on the variant:

a) Legacy and Simple:
   The user interface is easy to understand. Just browse the menu to remotely
   control your music player.
b) Canvas
   You can use your joystick and numpad to remotely control your music player:
   - use up and down keys to switch to previous / next song
   - use left and right keys to adjust volume (the longer your press, the bigger
     the adjustment)
   - use fire/select key to toogle play and pause
   - use * and # to adjust rating
   - use 0 to show the music player's current playlist
   In addition there are some menu-commands similar to the 'Simple' client.
   There you can change the Theme (or Skin) and inspect the log messages (if
   something does not work as you would like to).
