Remuco (remuco.sf.net) - Client
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction
************

Remuco is a bluetooh remote control system for music player. In addition to
controlling, it displays handy information about the music player currently
controlled (playlist, infos about the current song). If the music player
supports that, it is even possible to rate your songs remotely. 

This is the Remuco client, an application running on a mobile device with J2ME
and Bluetooth support.

Building
********

If you've got source package see documentation within the file 'build.xml' for
how to build a binary pacakge.

Installation
************

If you've got or built a binary package, unpack it and copy the jar and jad file
on your J2ME capable and Bluetooth enabled mobile device.

Once they are on your mobile device, you need to install them. This is device
dependent. For example on a Sony Ericsson K750i, you browse to the copied files
and choose install on the jad file. The process should be similar for other
devices.

On some mobiles you may instead make use of special software to install applications
on the mobile. The documentation of your mobile should be the best place to
find out how to install java applications on the mobile.

How to use
**********

Once the client is installed and started on your mobile device, you get prompted
with a screen to scan for a device running the Remuco server. So push the
button 'Scan' and .. wait. After some seconds, a list of neighbour devices is
found. Choose your computer which runs the Remuco server (make sure the
server is running!).

After 2 more seconds you should see some infos about your music player (the one
you specified, when started the server on the computer). There may be
a song (if the player currently has an active song) and there should be the
players state (playing, stopped, ..).

Now explore the severel commands, listed in the menu. I hope they are self
explaining. Have fun !
