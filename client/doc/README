     Remuco is a Bluetooth remote control system for Linux media players. With
    Remuco you can remotely control your favorite media player - amongst others
    you can switch to the next, previous or any other media within the current
    playlist, browse your media library, rate your media and adjust volume. On
    the mobile (i.e. the remote control) it displays information about the
    current media, including cover art. Visit remuco.sf.net for a complete
    feature list, screenshots and a list of supported media players.

1. Introduction

 This documentation is about the Remuco client, an application running on a
mobile device with J2ME and Bluetooth (JSR 82) support. The Remuco client
communicates with the Remuco server (respectively a specific player proxy) to
remotely control (music) players.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

2. Building

 The client uses the Ant build system (  http://ant.apache.org/ ), so make sure
Ant is installed on your system. To build the client, edit the file
build.properties and adjust it to your situation. Then run:

$ ant dist.jar

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

3. Installation

 The client application is in the file dist/remuco.jar and the application's
descriptor is in the file dist/remuco.jad . Install them on your phone (how to
do this is device dependent).

 Once you installed the client on your phone, consider to set permissions in
that way that Remuco is allowed to use Bluetooth. This releases you from allays
acknowledging y connection to the server (of course you need to trust Remuco :)
)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

4. Usage

 When you start the Remuco client, it automatically scans for near bluetooth
devices. After a few seconds it presents you a list of detected devices. Choose
your computer which runs the Remuco server.

 The client then connects to the server. Once the connection is up, you see the
current music player state displayed on your device.

 Play around with the keys and the entries in the menus, I think that's the
best way to get familiar with the client. Some notes anyway: If your change the
key configuration, the change applies immediately but it get stored only when
the client exits.

A.2. Source Code Access

 You can get the source code via SVN. The SVN root is: https://
remuco.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/remuco

 To browse the SVN repository visit: http://remuco.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/
remuco

 The most current code is located in "trunk" . Note that this code is not
always stable or in a working state. The sources of specific releases of the
several parts of the Remuco system (server library, client, ...) are located in
"tags" -- getting code from "tags" ensures to have working code.

Example A-1. Check out the current development version of the server library
into the directory remuco-server-trunk:

  $ svn co <SVN-ROOT>/trunk/server remuco-server-trunk

Example A-2. Check out the client source from release 0.6.0 into the directory
remuco-client-0.6.0:

  $ svn co <SVN-ROOT>/tags/remuco-client-0.6.0 remuco-client-0.6.0
