   Remuco is a Bluetooth remote control system for Linux media
   players. With Remuco you can remotely control your favorite
   media player - amongst others you can switch to the next,
   previous or any other media within the current playlist,
   browse your media library, rate your media and adjust volume.
   On the mobile (i.e. the remote control) it displays
   information about the current media, including cover art.
   Visit remuco.sf.net for a complete feature list, screenshots
   and a list of supported media players.

1. Introduction

   This documentation is about the Remuco client, an application
   running on a mobile device with J2ME and Bluetooth (JSR 82)
   support. The Remuco client communicates with the Remuco server
   (respectively a specific player proxy) to remotely control
   (music) players.

3. Installation

   The two files remuco.jar and remuco.jad (on some devices you
   only need the jar-file) of a particluar client variant needs
   to be installed on your mobile. How this is done is device
   dependent. Inspect the manual of your mobile for how to
   install Java ME applications.

   E.g. on a Sony Ericcson K750i you copy the files onto the
   memory stick. Then you browse to that file with the mobiles
   file browser and select 'install' on the jad-file. Some Nokia
   phones require to use special software on your computer to
   install something on the mobile. .. as said, please inspect
   your mobile's manual.

4. Usage

   When you start the Remuco client, it automatically scans for
   near bluetooth devices. After a few seconds it presents you a
   list of detected devices. Choose your computer which runs the
   Remuco server.

   The client then connects to the server. Once the connection is
   up, you see the current music player state displayed on your
   device.

A.2. Source Code Access

   You can get the source code via SVN. The SVN root is:

   https://remuco.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/remuco

   To browse the SVN repository visit:

   http://remuco.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/remuco

   The most current code is located in 'trunk'. Note that this
   code is not always stable or in a working state. The sources
   of specific releases of the several parts of the Remuco system
   (server library, client, ...) are located in 'tags' -- getting
   code from 'tags' ensures to have working code.

   Example A-1. Check out the current development version of the
   server library into the directory remuco-lib-trunk: 

   $ svn co <SVN-ROOT>/trunk/lib remuco-lib-trunk

   Example A-2. Check out the client source from release 0.6.0
   into the directory remuco-client-0.6.0: 

   $ svn co <SVN-ROOT>/tags/remuco-client-0.6.0 \
   remuco-client-0.6.0
