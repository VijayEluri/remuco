/**
 * Screenies represent some data in form of an image (so called
 * <i>representation image</i>). Screenies know their position and size so they
 * can draw themselves (i.e. their representation images) into a
 * {@link Graphics} object via {@link #draw(Graphics)} and give information
 * where to place adjacent screenies (see {@link #getNextX()} and
 * {@link #getNextY()} etc.).
 * <p>
 * Screenies create their representation images using graphical data from
 * {@link Theme}. So when ever the {@link Theme} changes,
 * {@link #initRepresentation(int, int, int, int)} must get called by classes
 * which use screenies. This method must also get called when a screenies
 * position or the available screen size changes. This is mostly a consequence
 * of a change in {@link Theme}. Screeny implementations must ensure that the
 * size of their representation images does <i>not</i> change between two calls
 * to {@link #initRepresentation(int, int, int, int)}. On the other side,
 * screeny users must ensure that this method gets called before the above
 * mentioned <code>update(..)</code> method gets called the first time.
 * <p>
 * Simple summary: The input of a screeny is some data and the output is a
 * corresponding image which can be drawn with {@link #draw(Graphics)} into an
 * {@link Graphics} object.
 * <p>
 * Notes for subclasses:<br>
 * Whenever the data to present by a screeny gets updated,
 * {@link #dataUpdated()} will be called. However this is just for notification,
 * the actual updating of the screeny's representation image must be done in
 * {@link #updateRepresentation()}.
