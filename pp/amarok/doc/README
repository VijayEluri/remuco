   Remuco is a bluetooh remote control system for linux media
   players. With Remuco you can remotely control your favourite
   media player - amongst others you can switch to the next,
   previous or any other media within the current playlist,
   browse your media library, rate your media and adjust volume.
   On the mobile (i.e. the remote control) it displays
   information about the current media, including cover art.
   Visit remuco.sf.net for a complete feature list, screenshots
   and a list of supported media players.

1. Introduction

   This documentation is about the Remuco player proxy for
   Amarok.
     _________________________________________________________

2. Features

   The Remuco system offers various media player related remote
   control features. Most player proxies only implement a subset
   of these features, since not every feature makes sense for
   every media player. The Amarok player proxy supports the
   following Remuco features:

     * Inspect and browse the playlist.
     * Display album art of the currently played track.
     * Rate your tracks.
     * Display repeat and shuffle status (see also sec. Known
       Issues ).
     * Browse and load predefined playlists.
     * Edit track meta information (see also sec. Known Issues ).

3. Installation

   Before you install the Remuco Amarok player proxy, make sure
   the Remuco server library and the Python binding for the
   Remuco server library are already installed.

   Start Amarok's script manager (Tools -> Script Manager) and
   choose 'Install Script'. Then select the Remuco Amarok package
   you've downloaded, e.g. remuco-amarok-123.amarokscript.tar.gz.
     _________________________________________________________

4. Usage

   In Amarok's script manager select the Remuco script and press
   'Run'. Once running, the script will get started automatically
   when you start Amarok the next time.

5. Known Issues

   Editing track meta information:

   Unfortunately editing track meta information (artist, title,
   ..) with the Remuco client works not allways as expected. The
   changes you make with the Remuco client will be applied to the
   Amarok database (not to the music files), but Amarok does not
   immediatly reflect the changes on its application window.
   Further, all changes made by the Remuco client are lost once
   you edit some other meta information within Amarok. For
   instance you change the album of a track from 'A' to 'B' using
   Remuco. Then this change is in the DB but not in the MP3 file
   (or OGG or ..). After a while you edit the title of the same
   track from 'X' to 'Y'. Amarok changes the title in the DB and
   in the MP3 file and sets album back to 'A' because this value
   is still stored in the actual MP3 file.

   Editing the 'comment' of track is not possible.

   Repeat status:

   Amarok has some kind of 'album repeat' but this state is
   hidden outside Amarok and so hidden for the Remuco client.

   Loading a playlist with the client:

   The DCOP interface of Amarok only provides the playlists a
   user has added, not the ones already present in a fresh Amarok
   installation. So with the client you can only load these user
   added playlists.

   If 2 playlists have the same name, it is not sure which list
   Amarok actually loads.

   When listening to streams, Amarok sometimes seems to be very
   busy so that the Remuco server respectively the Amrok player
   proxy cannot talk to Amarok. In this case the whole Remuco
   system seems to block.

6. Troubleshooting

   If there are some errors with the Remuco script and the
   displayed error message is no help for you or there is no
   message at all, try to start the script from a console (while
   Amarok is up):

   $ cd ~/kde/share/apps/amarok/scripts/remuco

   $ ./remuco-amarok.py

   Virtually this is the same as if you start the Remuco Amarok
   player proxy within Amarok but it will give you some logging
   output that hopefully helps you detecting your problem.
   However, feel free to ask for support at the help forum (see
   appendix below).

A.2. Source Code Access

   You can get the source code via SVN. The SVN root is:

   To browse the SVN repository visit:

   The most current code is located in 'trunk'. Note that this
   code is not allways stable or in a working state. The sources
   of specific releases are located in 'tags' -- getting code
   from 'tags' ensures to have working code.

   Example A-1. Checkout the current development version of the
   server into the directory remuco-server-trunk: 

   $ svn co <SVN-ROOT>/trunk/server remuco-server-trunk

   Example A-2. Check out the client source from release 0.6.0
   into the directory remuco-client-0.6.0: 

   $ svn co <SVN-ROOT>/tags/remuco-client-0.6.0 \
   remuco-client-0.6.0
