   Remuco is a Bluetooth remote control system for Linux media
   players. With Remuco you can remotely control your favorite
   media player - amongst others you can switch to the next,
   previous or any other media within the current playlist,
   browse your media library, rate your media and adjust volume.
   On the mobile (i.e. the remote control) it displays
   information about the current media, including cover art.
   Visit remuco.sf.net for a complete feature list, screenshots
   and a list of supported media players.

1. Introduction

   This documentation is about the Remuco player proxy for
   Amarok.
     _________________________________________________________

2. Features

   At http://remuco.sourceforge.net/index.php?title=Features you
   can find a list of all Remuco features.

   The Amarok player proxy supports the following of these
   features:

     * View and browse the playlist.
     * Album art.
     * Rating.
     * View repeat and shuffle status (see also Known Issues).
     * Browse and load predefined playlists (see also Known
       Issues).
     * Edit track meta information (see also Known Issues).
     _________________________________________________________

3. Installation

   Prerequisites:

     * Remuco server library 0.5.x
     * Remuco server library - Python binding 0.5.x
     * DCOP tool (on Debian/Ubuntu contained in kdelibs4c2a)
     * Python DCOP interface (for Python 2.5)
     * Python KDE interface (for Python 2.5)

   Start Amarok's script manager (Tools -> Script Manager) and
   choose "Install Script". Then select the Remuco Amarok package
   you've downloaded, e.g. remuco-amarok-123.amarokscript.tar.gz.
     _________________________________________________________

4. Usage

   In Amarok's script manager select the Remuco script and press
   "Run". Once running, the script will get started automatically
   when you start Amarok the next time.

5. Known Issues

   This is a seemingly long list of issues. However, the issues
   mostly relate to quite exotic situations. Most of the features
   work very well.

     * Editing a song's meta information (artist, title, ..) with
       the Remuco client is possible, but not recommended. The
       reason is that the changes you made are applied to the
       Amarok database but not to the music files (MP3, ..).
       Well, that's no big problem so far. However, once you edit
       the meta information of a song within Amarok, you will
       lost the changes you made previously with the Remuco
       client. Amarok writes the information you just changed to
       the music file, and then copies all information from the
       file to the database, this is the moment your previous
       Remuco-made changes die.
     * Two more issues on editing meta information with the
       client: The changes you make are not immediately visible
       in Amarok. Editing the comment to a song is not possible.
     * Amarok has some kind of album repeat mode but this mode is
       hidden outside Amarok and so hidden for the Remuco system.
     * The library you can see on the client only contains
       playlists added by you. The lists contained in a fresh
       Amarok installation are not included.
     * In case you have two or more playlists in Amarok with the
       same name, it is not sure which playlist Amarok will play
       when you load the list with the client.
     * When you play an imported playlist, you won't see any meta
       info about the contained songs. Amarok does not correlate
       the songs in imported playlists to appropriate songs in
       its database (which is the source where Remuco gets song
       meta information from).

6. Troubleshooting

   If you have problems running the player proxy, try to start
   the script from the command line (while Amarok is up):
$ cd ~/kde/share/apps/amarok/scripts/remuco

   $ cd ~/kde/share/apps/amarok/scripts/remuco

   $ ./remuco-amarok.py

   Virtually this is the same as if you start the player proxy
   within Amarok but it will give you some logging output that
   hopefully helps you detecting your problem. However, feel free
   to ask for support at the help forum (see Feedback, Help,
   Bugs, Discussion etc.).

A.2. Source Code Access

   You can get the source code via SVN. The SVN root is:
   https://remuco.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/remuco

   To browse the SVN repository visit:
   http://remuco.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/remuco

   The most current code is located in 'trunk'. Note that this
   code is not always stable or in a working state. The sources
   of specific releases of the several parts of the Remuco system
   (server library, client, ...) are located in 'tags' -- getting
   code from 'tags' ensures to have working code.

   Example A-1. Check out the current development version of the
   server library into the directory remuco-lib-trunk: 

   $ svn co <SVN-ROOT>/trunk/lib remuco-lib-trunk

   Example A-2. Check out the client source from release 0.6.0
   into the directory remuco-client-0.6.0: 

   $ svn co <SVN-ROOT>/tags/remuco-client-0.6.0 \
   remuco-client-0.6.0
