   Remuco is a Bluetooth remote control system for Linux media
   players. With Remuco you can remotely control your favorite
   media player - amongst others you can switch to the next,
   previous or any other media within the current playlist,
   browse your media library, rate your media and adjust volume.
   On the mobile (i.e. the remote control) it displays
   information about the current media, including cover art.
   Visit remuco.sf.net for a complete feature list, screenshots
   and a list of supported media players.

1. Introduction

   The Python binding is an interface to the Remuco server
   library for player proxies written in Python. It must be
   installed in order to use a Python player proxy, for instance
   the one for Amarok.

   $ make

   This automatically checks for build requirements.

3. Installation

   To install, run (with super user privileges):

   $ make install

   This installs into /usr/... If you prefer another prefix, e.g.
   /usr/local, run the following instead:

A.2. Source Code Access

   You can get the source code via SVN. The SVN root is:

   https://remuco.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/remuco

   To browse the SVN repository visit:

   http://remuco.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/remuco

   The most current code is located in 'trunk'. Note that this
   code is not always stable or in a working state. The sources
   of specific releases of the several parts of the Remuco system
   (server library, client, ...) are located in 'tags' -- getting
   code from 'tags' ensures to have working code.

   Example A-1. Check out the current development version of the
   server library into the directory remuco-lib-trunk: 

   $ svn co <SVN-ROOT>/trunk/lib remuco-lib-trunk

   Example A-2. Check out the client source from release 0.6.0
   into the directory remuco-client-0.6.0: 

   $ svn co <SVN-ROOT>/tags/remuco-client-0.6.0 \
   remuco-client-0.6.0
