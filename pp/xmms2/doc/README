     Remuco is a Bluetooth remote control system for Linux media players. With
    Remuco you can remotely control your favorite media player - amongst others
    you can switch to the next, previous or any other media within the current
    playlist, browse your media library, rate your media and adjust volume. On
    the mobile (i.e. the remote control) it displays information about the
    current media, including cover art. Visit remuco.sf.net for a complete
    feature list, screenshots and a list of supported media players.

installed in the startup scripts directory).

7. Troubleshooting

 If you have problems with the XMMS2 player proxy, temporary move it from the
XMMS2 startup scripts directory to another location (e.g. path/to), restart the
XMMS2 daemon and then start the player proxy by hand:

 $ path/to/remuco-xmms2

 The most current code is located in "trunk" . Note that this code is not
always stable or in a working state. The sources of specific releases of the
several parts of the Remuco system (server library, client, ...) are located in
"tags" -- getting code from "tags" ensures to have working code.

Example A-1. Check out the current development version of the server library
into the directory remuco-server-trunk:

  $ svn co <SVN-ROOT>/trunk/server remuco-server-trunk

Example A-2. Check out the client source from release 0.6.0 into the directory
remuco-client-0.6.0:

  $ svn co <SVN-ROOT>/tags/remuco-client-0.6.0 remuco-client-0.6.0
