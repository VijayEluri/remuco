A.2. Source Code Access

 You can get the source code via SVN. The SVN root is: https://

 The most current code is located in "trunk" . Note that this code is not
always stable or in a working state. The sources of specific releases of the
several parts of the Remuco system (server library, client, ...) are located in
"tags" -- getting code from "tags" ensures to have working code.

Example A-1. Check out the current development version of the server library
into the directory remuco-server-trunk:

  $ svn co <SVN-ROOT>/trunk/server remuco-server-trunk

Example A-2. Check out the client source from release 0.6.0 into the directory
remuco-client-0.6.0:

  $ svn co <SVN-ROOT>/tags/remuco-client-0.6.0 remuco-client-0.6.0
